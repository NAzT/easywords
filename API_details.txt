The category blocks that the API returns can be any of the following:

PrincipalTranslations - the main entries found for the searched term.
AdditionalTranslations - other entries for the term aside from the principal translations.
Entries - entries when they are not divided between principal and additional translations.
OtherSideEntires - for some dictionaries, we do a 'reverse dictionary' in that we return entries from the opposite side (e.g searching Czech to English will search entries on the English to Czech dictionary).
Compounds - compound terms or phrases that include the searched term. These will only show up under the "original" object, not under any of the "term#" objects.
The term0, term1, term2, etc. objects can contain the first four category-block types, while the original object type will only contain a Compounds category-block.
